Introduction
============
This folder contains annotations of the playing techniques (Flam and Drag) from two online drum lesson. The videos are simple demonstrations of the playing techniques performed on the snare drum with a tempo ranging from slow to fast. The annotations of these videos consist of onset times of the snare hits. The MATLAB scripts for estimating the parameters for sound synthesis are also included in this folder.

The videos for the online drum lessons can be found in the following links:

Note that the annotated onset times have an approximately 512*3 samples difference if read by MATLAB audioread( ) function. This difference has be compensated in the MATLAB scripts.
