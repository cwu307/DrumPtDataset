// DrumPtDataset V1.00
// Latest update: May 2016 

Introduction
============
DrumPtDataset is a collection of datasets that are created for drum playing technique detection related research. The dataset contains three folders:

- Parameter_estimation: this folder contains annotations and MATLAB scripts for estimating the parameters of Flam and Drag from the online drum lesson videos.  

- Testing_set: this folder contains annotations of drum playing techniques for the ENST drum minus one subset. 

- Training_set_gen: this folder contains the MATLAB scripts for augmenting the existing MDLib2.2 with synthetic Flam and Drag audio samples. The audio files are not provided due to the copyright restrictions. 

For more detailed information, please refer to the following publication: 

Chih-Wei Wu, Alexander Lerch, On Drum Playing Technique Detection in Polyphonic Mixtures, in Proceedings of the International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR), New York, 2016.
